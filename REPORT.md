# Feature 1 â€“ Project Setup and Initial Build

**Tasks Completed**
- Created repo BSDSF23M032-OS-A02 on GitHub.
- Cloned repo to Kali.
- Created src, bin, obj, man folders.
- Added starter file ls-v1.0.0.c and Makefile.
- Built executable successfully using make.

**Learning**
- Learned how gcc and make compile C programs.
- Understood directory structure for project builds.
- Practiced basic git commands: clone, add, commit, push, tag.

**Verification**
- make created bin/ls executable.
- ./bin/ls listed files correctly.

# Feature 2 â€“ Long Listing (-l)

### 1. What is the crucial difference between the `stat()` and `lstat()` system calls? In the context of the `ls` command, when is it more appropriate to use `lstat()`?

The crucial difference lies in how they handle **symbolic links**:

- **`stat()`**: Follows a symbolic link and returns information about the **target file** that the link points to.  
  Example: If `file_link` â†’ `real_file.txt`, then `stat("file_link")` shows details of `real_file.txt`.

- **`lstat()`**: Returns information about the **link itself**, not the target.  
  Example: `lstat("file_link")` shows details of `file_link` (file type = symbolic link, its own size/permissions, etc.).

âœ… In the context of the `ls` command, **`lstat()` is more appropriate** because `ls -l` must show symbolic links distinctly (with `l` at the start of the permission string and the `-> target` display). Using only `stat()` would make symbolic links appear as normal files.

### 2. The `st_mode` field in `struct stat` is an integer that contains both the file type (e.g., regular file, directory) and the permission bits. Explain how you can use bitwise operators (like `&`) and predefined macros (like `S_IFDIR` or `S_IRUSR`) to extract this information.

The field `st_mode` in `struct stat` encodes two types of information in one integer:

1. **File type** (regular file, directory, symbolic link, etc.)  
2. **Permission bits** (read, write, execute for owner, group, and others)

---

#### ðŸ“Œ File Type Extraction
Use predefined macros with bitwise operations to check type:

```c
if (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("This is a directory\n");
}
if (S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("This is a regular file\n");
}
