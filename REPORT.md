# Feature 1 â€“ Project Setup and Initial Build

**Tasks Completed**
- Created repo BSDSF23M032-OS-A02 on GitHub.
- Cloned repo to Kali.
- Created src, bin, obj, man folders.
- Added starter file ls-v1.0.0.c and Makefile.
- Built executable successfully using make.

**Learning**
- Learned how gcc and make compile C programs.
- Understood directory structure for project builds.
- Practiced basic git commands: clone, add, commit, push, tag.

**Verification**
- make created bin/ls executable.
- ./bin/ls listed files correctly.

# Feature 2 â€“ Long Listing (-l)

### 1. What is the crucial difference between the `stat()` and `lstat()` system calls? In the context of the `ls` command, when is it more appropriate to use `lstat()`?

The crucial difference lies in how they handle **symbolic links**:

- **`stat()`**: Follows a symbolic link and returns information about the **target file** that the link points to.  
  Example: If `file_link` â†’ `real_file.txt`, then `stat("file_link")` shows details of `real_file.txt`.

- **`lstat()`**: Returns information about the **link itself**, not the target.  
  Example: `lstat("file_link")` shows details of `file_link` (file type = symbolic link, its own size/permissions, etc.).

âœ… In the context of the `ls` command, **`lstat()` is more appropriate** because `ls -l` must show symbolic links distinctly (with `l` at the start of the permission string and the `-> target` display). Using only `stat()` would make symbolic links appear as normal files.

---

### 2. The `st_mode` field in `struct stat` is an integer that contains both the file type (e.g., regular file, directory) and the permission bits. Explain how you can use bitwise operators (like `&`) and predefined macros (like `S_IFDIR` or `S_IRUSR`) to extract this information.

The field `st_mode` in `struct stat` encodes two types of information in one integer:

1. **File type** (regular file, directory, symbolic link, etc.)  
2. **Permission bits** (read, write, execute for owner, group, and others)

---

#### ðŸ“Œ File Type Extraction
Use predefined macros with bitwise operations to check type:

```c
if (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("This is a directory\n");
}
if (S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
    printf("This is a regular file\n");
}

# Feature 3 â€“ Column Display (down-then-across)

### 3. Explain the general logic for printing items in a "down then across" columnar format. Why is a simple single loop through the list of filenames insufficient for this task?

The "down then across" format prints filenames vertically in columns instead of left-to-right row by row. The general steps are:

1. Store all filenames in an array.
2. Find the maximum filename length to determine the column width.
3. Detect the terminal width and calculate:
   - `col_width = maxlen + padding`
   - `ncols = term_width / col_width`
   - `nrows = ceil(nfiles / ncols)`
4. Print with two nested loops:
   - Outer loop â†’ rows
   - Inner loop â†’ columns
   - Index formula: `index = c * nrows + r`
   - Print only if `index < nfiles`.

Example layout:
a d g
b e h
c f i

A simple single loop is insufficient because it only prints items row by row (left to right), not in the required down-then-across column format.

---

### 4. What is the purpose of the `ioctl` system call in this context? What would be the limitations of your program if you only used a fixed-width fallback (e.g., 80 columns) instead of detecting the terminal size?

The `ioctl` system call (with `TIOCGWINSZ`) is used to detect the terminalâ€™s current width in characters. This makes it possible to dynamically calculate how many columns of filenames can fit without breaking alignment.

If only a fixed-width fallback like 80 columns were used:
- On wide terminals â†’ wasted space, fewer columns than possible.
- On narrow terminals â†’ lines may wrap incorrectly, breaking formatting.
- The program would not adjust when the terminal window is resized.

Using `ioctl` ensures the layout adapts to the actual terminal size, giving correct and consistent results.


# Feature 5 â€“ Alphabetical Sort (v1.4.0)

**Q1: Why read all entries into memory before sorting? Drawbacks for millions of files**
- Sorting requires comparing arbitrary elements multiple times; to compare any two entries efficiently you must have random access to them. Reading all entries into a memory array provides O(1) access to any element during comparisons.
- Drawbacks for very large directories:
  - **High memory usage**: storing millions of filenames uses a lot of RAM (O(N * avg_filename_length)). This can cause swapping or OOM failures.
  - **Time & I/O**: reading and allocating that many strings is slow; sorting is O(N log N) time and may be CPU-heavy.
  - **Alternatives**: external sort (store on-disk and sort in chunks), stream-based partial results, or limit sorting to a window (e.g., top K). For practical systems, tools sometimes use on-disk temporary files or database indexes for extremely large directories.

**Q2: Purpose and signature of the comparison function for `qsort()`**
- `qsort()` is generic: it sorts an array of `nmemb` elements, each of `size` bytes. It needs a comparator to know how to order elements.
- Signature: `int cmp(const void *a, const void *b)`. The comparator:
  - Receives pointers to array elements as `const void *`.
  - Must cast those to the specific element type pointer inside the function (for strings: `const char * const *`).
  - Returns a negative integer if `a < b`, zero if `a == b`, positive if `a > b`.
- Example used: `cmp_strptr()` casts inputs to `const char *const *` and returns `strcmp(*pa, *pb)`. This makes `qsort()` arrange strings in ascending alphabetical order.

**Notes**
- The comparator uses `strcmp()` (case-sensitive). Use `strcasecmp()` for case-insensitive ordering if required.
- Hidden files (names starting with `.`) are still skipped by default; if `-a` is implemented later, the sorting logic will work unchanged (it will include those entries too).
